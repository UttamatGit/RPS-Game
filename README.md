# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using Python and Tkinter for the GUI. The game allows the user to select one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and then plays against the system which randomly chooses an option.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This game is written in Python 3.
2. Install Tkinter if it is not already installed. Tkinter usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if you need to install it, you can do so using:
   ```sh
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```
  or for Windows:
   ```sh
   pip install tk
   ```
3. Save the provided Python script to a file, for example rock_paper_scissors.py.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   RPS.py
   ```
   
## How to Play
1. Open the game by running the script.
2. Enter your choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) in the text entry box.
3. Click the "PLAY" button to see the result.
4. Click the "RESET" button to clear the result and make a new choice.
5. Click the "EXIT" button to close the game.

## Game Logic
* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beat Paper
* Paper beats Rock
* If both the user and the system choose the same option, the game is a tie.
